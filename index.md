## About me
Hi, I’m Eneida Likaj, a sophomore at Whitman College studying Economics with a minor in Finance. 
Throughout my academic journey, I’ve had the opportunity to be involved in various leadership roles, such as organizing Whitman’s first-ever Codecraft Hackathon, taking the lead for clubs such as GDG on Campus, and being part of the Student Government, this year as a member of the Finance Committee. Additionally, I’ve gained practical experience working as a teaching assistant last semester for Prof. Manumuru for the Statistics in Economics course.
Beyond academics, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, shown through my involvement in mentoring students in coding and my work in this summer's community-based STEM initiative.
I’m particularly interested in pursuing financial and business consulting in the future, where I can combine my knowledge of finance, economics, and technology to help organizations optimize their strategies. 

## Portfolio Overview
While I have previously worked with HTML, C++, Java and Python, academically I have supported these sills by taking the course of Computational Porblem Solving (167) in pyhton, Data Structures (270) in Java, and Data Science (215) in Pyhton.
Especially during my Data Science course I had the opportunity to work and exlore closely Python libraries such as pandas, matplot, numpy etc. Some of the projects I have worked on include colleting and cleaning experimental data gathered from my phone's light sensor through Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite to measure the light intensity for 2 days, plot them graphicaly and determine a possible day-length difference between the two days, as the time where the experiement took place was right after the summer solstice and before the fall equinox.
