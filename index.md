## About me
Hi, I’m Eneida Likaj, a sophomore at Whitman College studying Economics with a minor in Finance. 
Throughout my academic journey, I’ve had the opportunity to be involved in various leadership roles, such as organizing Whitman’s first-ever Codecraft Hackathon, taking the lead for clubs such as GDG on Campus, and being part of the Student Government, this year as a member of the Finance Committee. Additionally, I’ve gained practical experience working as a teaching assistant last semester for Prof. Manumuru for the Statistics in Economics course.
Beyond academics, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, shown through my involvement in mentoring students in coding and my work in this summer's community-based STEM initiative.
I’m particularly interested in pursuing financial and business consulting in the future, where I can combine my knowledge of finance, economics, and technology to help organizations optimize their strategies. 

## Portfolio Overview
While I have previously worked with HTML, C++, Java and Python, academically I have supported these skills by taking the course of Computational Porblem Solving (167) in pyhton, Data Structures (270) in Java, and Data Science (215) in Pyhton.
Especially during my Data Science course I had the opportunity to work and exlore closely Python libraries such as pandas, matplot, numpy etc. 

1. In one of my first projects I have worked on this semester included colleting and cleaning experimental data gathered from my phone's light sensor through Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite to measure the light intensity for 2 days, plot them graphicaly and determine a possible day-length difference between the two days, as the time where the experiement took place was right after the summer solstice and before the fall equinox.

2. In another project, datasets on student grades and demographics were merged to explore course performance, major impact, and GPA trends. Key findings include ECON majors taking diverse 1xx-level courses, non-ECON and CHEM majors outperforming ECON majors in BIOL courses, and Double and Triple Majors consistently achieving higher GPAs than Single Majors. GPA trends from 2003–2018 showed improvement for Single Majors and consistently strong performance for Double and Triple Majors.

3. One of my bigger projects involved transforming Google location data from Prof. Schueller's phone into a structured pandas DataFrame indexed by datetime, with latitude and longitude columns.

On eof my hypothesises for that project was that Prof. Schueller’s weekend travel patterns have likely changed over time, especially when comparing the movement behaviours in 2015 (pre-pandemic), 2020, and 2023 (post-pandemic) show more frequent weekend travel compared to 2021, when pandemic restrictions might have limited his mobility.

The timelapse heatmaps support the hypothesis that Prof. Schueller had more diverse and extended travel patterns in 2019 and 2022 compared to 2020. During the pandemic year, his movements were noticeably more localized, likely reflecting travel restrictions or limited mobility. In contrast, 2019 and 2022 include international and further domestic travels.
