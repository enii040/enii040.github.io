##About me
Hi, I’m Eneida Likaj, a sophomore at Whitman College studying Economics with a minor in Finance. 
Throughout my academic journey, I’ve had the opportunity to be involved in various leadership roles, such as organizing Whitman’s first-ever Codecraft Hackathon, taking the lead for clubs such as GDG on Campus, and being part of the Student Government, this year as a member of the Finance Committee. Additionally, I’ve gained practical experience working as a teaching assistant last semester for Prof. Manumuru for the Statistics in Economics course.
Beyond academics, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, shown through my involvement in mentoring students in coding and my work in this summer's community-based STEM initiative.
I’m particularly interested in pursuing financial and business consulting in the future, where I can combine my knowledge of finance, economics, and technology to help organizations optimize their strategies.
