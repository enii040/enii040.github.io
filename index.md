## About me
Hi, I’m Eneida Likaj, a sophomore at Whitman College majoring in Economics with a minor in Finance.
Throughout my academic journey, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, such as organizing Whitman’s first-ever Codecraft Hackathon, leading clubs like GDG on Campus, and serving in student government, currently as a member of the Finance Committee. Additionally, I’ve gained practical experience as a teaching assistant for Prof. Manumuru’s Statistics in Economics course last semester.
Beyond academics, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, exemplified by mentoring students in coding and contributing to a community-based STEM initiative this summer. I aspire to pursue a career in financial and business consulting, where I can combine my knowledge of finance, economics, and technology to help organizations optimize their strategies.


## Portfolio Overview
I’ve worked with several programming languages, including HTML, C++, Java, and Python, and have supported my skills academically through courses such as Computational Problem Solving (167) in Python, Data Structures (270) in Java, and Data Science (215) in Python.
During my Data Science course, I explored libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Plotly, applying them to various projects:

1. Daylight Comparison Project
I collected and cleaned experimental data using my phone's light sensor through the Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite. The project involved measuring light intensity over two days, plotting the data graphically, and determining day-length differences as part of a study conducted around the summer solstice and fall equinox.

2. Exploring Student Academic Performance
In another project, I merged datasets on student grades and demographics to explore course performance, major impacts, and GPA trends. Findings included insights such as:

ECON majors taking diverse 1xx-level courses.
Non-ECON and CHEM majors outperforming ECON majors in BIOL courses.
Double and Triple Majors consistently achieving higher GPAs than Single Majors.

## Where's Schueller?
One of my major projects involved transforming Google location data from Prof. Schueller's phone into a structured pandas DataFrame indexed by datetime, with latitude and longitude columns.

One hypothesis was that Prof. Schueller’s weekend travel patterns changed over time, particularly when comparing 2015 (pre-pandemic), 2020, and 2023 (post-pandemic). The analysis revealed more frequent travel in 2015 and 2023 compared to 2020, likely reflecting pandemic restrictions.

The timelapse heatmaps support the hypothesis that Prof. Schueller’s travel patterns were more localized during 2020, reflecting the impact of the pandemic.

## Approach to Projects
Interactive Development
I utilize Google Colab for iterative and interactive data analysis, ensuring clear documentation and visualization throughout the process.

Best Practices
Drawing from the Python Data Science Handbook, I follow structured workflows for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. This includes:
- Organizing code and comments for readability.
- Using modular functions to promote reusability and scalability.
- Incorporating rigorous testing to validate outputs.
- 
Libraries I’ve used include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Mapbox for map visualizations.

## Fact-Based Insights
One of the key insights I’ve gained from my projects is the importance of inclusive and representative data, a concept emphasized in Factfulness by Hans Rosling. Selection bias can lead to misleading conclusions when datasets fail to reflect population diversity. This experience has reinforced my commitment to thinking critically, identifying gaps in data, and seeking diverse sources to ensure fairness and equity in analysis and outcomes. Inspired by Rosling's call to avoid one-size-fits-all narratives, I strive to uncover meaningful insights that serve broader, more inclusive audiences.


## Data Sources and Project Ideas
Response: Val and I were looking at the Consumer Price Index data (https://www.bls.gov/cpi/).
One idea was to work with the time-series data of prices over different presidential
administrations in the US. [2009-2017 (Obama); 2017-2021 (Trump); 2021-2024(Biden)]
We could also see if the consumer price index of good baskets in the US has changed not in
line with other countries' price indexes.
