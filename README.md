## About me
Hi, I’m Eneida Likaj, a sophomore at Whitman College majoring in Economics with a minor in Finance.
Throughout my academic journey, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, such as organizing Whitman’s first-ever Codecraft Hackathon, leading clubs like GDG on Campus, and serving in student government, currently as a member of the Finance Committee. Additionally, I’ve gained practical experience as a teaching assistant for Prof. Manumuru’s Statistics in Economics course last semester.
Beyond academics, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, exemplified by mentoring students in coding and contributing to a community-based STEM initiative this summer. I aspire to pursue a career in financial and business consulting, where I can combine my knowledge of finance, economics, and technology to help organizations optimize their strategies.


## Portfolio Overview
I’ve worked with several programming languages, including HTML, C++, Java, and Python, and have supported my skills academically through courses such as Computational Problem Solving (167) in Python, Data Structures (270) in Java, and Data Science (215) in Python.
During my Data Science course, I explored libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Plotly, applying them to various projects:

1. Daylight Comparison Project
I collected and cleaned experimental data using my phone's light sensor through the Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite. The project involved measuring light intensity over two days, plotting the data graphically, and determining day-length differences as part of a study conducted around the summer solstice and fall equinox.

2. Exploring Student Academic Performance
In another project, I merged datasets on student grades and demographics to explore course performance, major impacts, and GPA trends. Findings included insights such as:

ECON majors taking diverse 1xx-level courses.
Non-ECON and CHEM majors outperforming ECON majors in BIOL courses.
Double and Triple Majors consistently achieving higher GPAs than Single Majors.
