## About me
Hi, I’m Eneida Likaj, a sophomore at Whitman College majoring in Economics with a minor in Finance.
Throughout my academic journey, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, such as organizing Whitman’s first-ever Codecraft Hackathon, leading clubs like GDG on Campus, and serving in student government, currently as a member of the Finance Committee. Additionally, I’ve gained practical experience as a teaching assistant for Prof. Manumuru’s Statistics in Economics course last semester.
Beyond academics, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, exemplified by mentoring students in coding and contributing to a community-based STEM initiative this summer. I aspire to pursue a career in financial and business consulting, where I can combine my knowledge of finance, economics, and technology to help organizations optimize their strategies.
